# DMX

This package is designed to control some ArtNet DMX fixtures in my bathroom.

By default the lights will move through a predefined sequence throughout the day, but deviations from that sequence can be made via API calls.

Via color changes, the lights will aid in the process of falling asleep at night, and waking up in the morning.
